abstract = {The de-facto standard topology for modern HPC systems and data-centers are Folded Clos networks, commonly known as Fat-Trees. The number of network endpoints in these systems is steadily increasing. The switch radix increase is not keeping up, forcing an increased path length in these multi-level trees that will limit gains for latency-sensitive applications. Additionally, today's Fat-Trees force the extensive use of active optical cables which carries a prohibitive cost-structure at scale. To tackle these issues, researchers proposed various low-diameter topologies, such as Dragonfly. Another novel, but only theoretically studied, option is the HyperX. We built the world's first 3 Pflop/s supercomputer with two separate networks, a 3--level Fat-Tree and a 12\texttimes{}8 HyperX. This dual-plane system allows us to perform a side-by-side comparison using a broad set of benchmarks. We show that the HyperX, together with our novel communication pattern-aware routing, can challenge the performance of, or even outperform, traditional Fat-Trees.},

abstract = {While parallelism remains the main source of performance, architectural implementations and programming models change with each new hardware generation, often leading to costly application re-engineering. Most tools for performance portability require manual and costly application porting to yet another programming model.We propose an alternative approach that automatically translates programs written in one programming model (CUDA), into another (CPU threads) based on Polygeist/MLIR. Our approach includes a representation of parallel constructs that allows conventional compiler transformations to apply transparently and without modification and enables parallelism-specific optimizations. We evaluate our framework by transpiling and optimizing the CUDA Rodinia benchmark suite for a multi-core CPU and achieve a 58% geomean speedup over handwritten OpenMP code. Further, we show how CUDA kernels from PyTorch can efficiently run and scale on the CPU-only Supercomputer Fugaku without user intervention. Our PyTorch compatibility layer making use of transpiled CUDA PyTorch kernels outperforms the PyTorch CPU native backend by 2.7\texttimes{}.},
