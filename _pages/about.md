I am a doctoral student at Tokyo Institute of Technology where I also obtained my Master's degree in Mathematical and Computing Science with a thesis on "Optimizations and Transformations of Parallel Code via High Level Intermediate Representation". My current interests include improving usability and performance of HPC software through programming frameworks, libraries, or compilers.
